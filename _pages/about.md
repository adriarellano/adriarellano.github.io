I am a Quantitative Research Fellow at the [University College London](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/98707-adrian-arellano) within the Faculty of Education and Society. I also hold a position as a Senior Researcher at the Peace Research Institute Oslo ([PRIO](https://www.prio.org/)).

My research focuses on the causes and consequences of conflict, at the national and subnational level. My methodological areas of interest include mathematical/computational modeling, causal inference techniques, and content analysis.

I received my PhD and M.A. from the Department of Political Science at the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/). I also hold a degree from the University of California, Davis (B.A.).
